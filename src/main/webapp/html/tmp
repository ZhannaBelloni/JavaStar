<p class='text'>Java divides the operators into the following groups:
<ul class='text'>
   <li> Arithmetic operators</li>
    <li>Assignment operators</li>
   <li> Comparison operators</li>
    <li>Logical operators</li>
    <li>Bitwise operators</li>
    </ul><br>
<h2 class='text'>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

These operators involve the mathematical operators that can be used to perform various simple or advanced arithmetic operations on the primitive data types referred to as the operands. These operators consist of various unary and binary operators that can be applied on a single or two operands. Letâ€™s look at the various operators that Java has to provide under the arithmetic operators.
