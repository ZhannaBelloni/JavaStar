<p class='text'>JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun
	Microsystems Inc in the year 1995, later acquired by Oracle
	Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing,
	compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable
	code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented
	programming language and is designed to have as few implementation
	dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made
	for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code
	can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are
	compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine.</p>

<h2 class='title'>Java History</h2>

<p class='text'>
	Java history is rich and vibrant. It all started with Patrick Naughton,
	James Gosling, and Mike Sheridan as they started working on a project
	in June 1991. The language is aimed to designed for interactive
	television. Initially, the language was named Oak because of the oak
	tree outside this office. With a name change of “Green,” it was finally
	named to Java. The final name is derived from Java coffee.<b></b> Java
	programming language is inspired by the C/C++ style according to
	Gosling. The aim was to create a programming language independent of
	the underlying machine architecture.<b></b> The first public release of
	Java happened in 1995 as Java 1.0. New versions were released with
	time. Java also became the open source on November 13, 2006. It was
	released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) terms. Java is a
	powerful programming language and is used almost everywhere, including
	small microchips to powerful supercomputers.
